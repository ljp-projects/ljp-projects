BoreCode is a save-as-you-code text editor.
The second you start editing a file, there is no going back (yet).
So be careful, and take heed.
Also before you try, no, you cannot edit this file.

Click the document icon to add a file to the current file group.
Click the plus button to add a file group.
Your file groups will show up in the sidebar.
Expand file groups to open their files.
When importing a file, make sure the contents are utf-8 encoded, or it will be very messed up.
As you edit text, the file is automatically saved. You cannot undo those actions, so be careful.
