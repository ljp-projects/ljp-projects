I make little side projects in a diverse range of programming and scripting languages. This is a list of my favourite languages I have had some experience with.

* Kotlin
* TypeScript
* Rust
* HTML
* CSS
* [Mosaic](https://github.com/ljp-projects/mosaic) (A language I created)

**_PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS AS ME SAYING I AM GOOD AT CSS_**

If you are a Scratch 'developer' please learn TypeScript ASAP. It will improve your quality of life.
If you are a Python 'developer' please abandon the AI hype train and learn Rust: it has crabs ü¶Ä, speed ‚ö°Ô∏è, and... **THE BORROW CHECKER** ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

I have been programming for about 2 years, and started with JavaScript.

pls send help I am addicted to Rust ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
do try Mosaic
just don't ask for documentation or installation instructions
the public standard library doesn't compile
so that's fun
