I make little side projects in a diverse range of programming and scripting languages. This is a list of my favourite languages I have had some experience with.

* Lua
* Ruby
* Kotlin
* TypeScript
* Nim
* Rust
* [Mosaic](https://github.com/ljp-projects/mosaic) (A language I created)

I have been programming for about 2 years, and started with JavaScript.
