I make little side projects in a diverse range of programming and scripting languages. This is a list of my favourite languages I have had some experience with.

* Lua
* Ruby
* Kotlin
* TypeScript
* Nim
* Rust

I have also made a programming language too! It is called TeaScript, and is located [here](https://github.com/ljp-projects/TeaScript). I wrote it in Kotlin, but previously it was in TypeScript.

I have been programming for about 1 year, and started with JavaScript.
